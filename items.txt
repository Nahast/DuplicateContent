Today, Nueva serves over 800 students PK-12 and expects to grow to over 950 students in the next few years.  Nueva is located in the neighboring towns of Hillsborough and San Mateo, equidistant between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, serving six different counties throughout the Bay Area of Northern California.\n \nA constructivist school, Nueva is known for its distinctive inquiry-based interdisciplinary studies, project-based learning, and pioneering work in social-emotional learning and design thinking. The Nueva community instills a passion for lifelong learning, fosters social and emotional acuity, and develops the imaginative mind.

The Upper School Innovation Lab (I-Lab) is a world renowned Design Thinking program housed within a state of the art fabrication facility and located on Nueva\'s brand new Bay Meadows campus. The facilities include a woodshop, a welding and metal fabrication space, a digital fabrication space, electronics equipment, and a budding jewelry and textiles infrastructure.

He showed students how math and science are part of the buildings, bridges, and communities that surround us.\nIn 1987, the Salvadori Center was founded with three main principles:\n\n\u2022\tEngage students through project-based exercises\n\u2022\tUse the built environment to illustrate the relevance of math and science\n\u2022\tEmploy collaborative problem solving that involves all learners\n\nToday, we hold true to our founding principles.

All Salvadori curricula link to Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and grade-specific learning objectives.\n\nAfter participating in Salvadori programs, thousands of students see their world differently.  They understand how buildings stand up, how bridges support such heavy loads and, most importantly, they understand "why they need to know this."\n\nSalvadori students achieve a greater understanding of math and science than students in traditional learning environments; they see it and feel it in the classes they enter, the bridges they cross, and the communities they live in.\n\nCompensation Package:\n\n\u2022\tSalary: $42,000 (increased to $46,200 after a successful first year)\n\u2022\t52 leave days a year\no\t15 vacation days\no\t16 holidays\no\t2 personal days\no\t9 sick days\no\t10 days\' summer leave (typically two consecutive weeks in August)\n\u2022\tno-cost individual health insurance (no co-pays, deductibles, or contribution), plus vision, dental, and life insurance\n\u2022\t403(b) plan where Salvadori contributes an additional 5% of employees\' salaries without a matching requirement\n\nHow to Apply:\n\nSubmit resume, cover letter and sample lesson plan (if available) in PDF format only to thecenter@salvadori.org by 31 July 2017 with the subject line: Salvadori Educator Application and please mention where you saw this ad in your cover letter and if you are applying for a full-time or part-time position.\n\nPlease use this format when submitting your application: \n\n\u2022\tFirstInitialLastName_Document ~ for example: \no\tJSmith_Resume\no\tJSmith_CoverLetter\no\tJSmith_LessonPlan (if available)\n\nNo calls, please.\n    ')('Title', u'Salvadori Educator')('URL', u'https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/salvadori-educator/6209154931.html')('Compensation', u'$42,000')('Address', '')('Employment Type', u'full-time')

He showed students how math and science are part of the buildings, bridges, and communities that surround us.\nIn 1987, the Salvadori Center was founded with three main principles:\n\n\u2022\tEngage students through project-based exercises\n\u2022\tUse the built environment to illustrate the relevance of math and science\n\u2022\tEmploy collaborative problem solving that involves all learners\n\nToday, we hold true to our founding principles.  Salvadori\'s programs celebrate our collaborative, hands-on and project-based approach to learning through the built environment with programs that:\n\n\u2022\tPromote college and career readiness for all students\n\u2022\tEmphasize higher-order skills\n\u2022\tProduce student work that reflects high levels of thinking, participation, and ownership\n\nWe offer a variety of multi-day in-school and after-school programs that enable every child to succeed, as well as professional development workshops that provide teachers with a strong foundation in project-based learning.  All Salvadori curricula link to Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and grade-specific learning objectives.\n\nAfter participating in Salvadori programs, thousands of students see their world differently.  They understand how buildings stand up, how bridges support such heavy loads and, most importantly, they understand "why they need to know this."\n\nSalvadori students achieve a greater understanding of math and science than students in traditional learning environments; they see it and feel it in the classes they enter, the bridges they cross, and the communities they live in.\n\nCompensation Package:\n\n\u2022\tSalary: $70,000 to $75,000\n\u2022\t52 leave days a year\no\t15 vacation days\no\t16 holidays\no\t2 personal days\no\t9 sick days\no\t10 days\' summer leave (typically two consecutive weeks in August)\n\u2022\tno-cost individual health insurance (no co-pays, deductibles, or contribution), plus vision, dental, and life insurance\n\u2022\t403(b) plan where Salvadori contributes an additional 5% of employees\' salaries without a matching requirement\n\nHow to Apply:\n\nSubmit resume and cover letter in PDF format only to thecenter@salvadori.org by 31 July 2017 with the subject line: Salvadori Education Director Application and please mention where you saw this ad in your cover letter.\n\nPlease use this format when submitting your application: \n\n\u2022\tFirstInitialLastName_Document ~ for example: \no\tJSmith_Resume\no\tJSmith_CoverLetter\n\nNo calls, please.\n    ')('Title', u'Education Director')('URL', u'https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/education-director/6212937267.html')('Compensation', u'$70,000-$75,000')('Address', u'New York')('Employment Type', u'full-time')

If you think you lack any, don't apply. You won't find this a good fit. Our core values are fundamental to our company in that our team members enjoy working with each other, learning from each other, and our company relies on people acting with INTEGRITY and ACCOUNTABILITY. HUMILITY should be a core value of everyone, but we just happen to take it very seriously because the process of learning starts with being humble. To be humble is to be modest, to understand that we are all still learning about the world so we must be open to learning from others. AGILITY is also important because this position requires the team member to respond to multiple demands of their time with grace, patience, and creativity. We strive to have a positive work place, so only positive-thinking people are encouraged to apply. We also strive to create a jovial and creative work environment that leaves plenty of room for the team members to have their own well-balanced lives, but because we are also an ambitious company, sometimes things can get a little stressful, though we work hard to minimize the times of stress. If you can manage your stress with grace under pressure, then this might be a good fit for you.\n\nOur company offers comprehensive development services to the home owner or the high-rise builder, and we are constantly seeking out ways to improve, automate, and simplify the building process for those who want to build, but just need a bit of help. We train our staff in all aspects of the building process. We are also a very generous company, offering free training support, bi-weekly full staff lunches, paid time off, and profit-sharing. We support our team members and make it a priority to help them grow in their areas of interest, be it improving their management skills, learning to become a builder, becoming project managers, or just taking on more responsibility for higher salary.

The Upper School Innovation Lab (I-Lab) is a world renowned Design Thinking program housed within a state of the art fabrication facility and located on Nueva\'s brand new Bay Meadows campus. The facilities include a woodshop, a welding and metal fabrication space, a digital fabrication space, electronics equipment, and a budding jewelry and textiles infrastructure.

He showed students how math and science are part of the buildings, bridges, and communities that surround us.\nIn 1987, the Salvadori Center was founded with three main principles:\n\n\u2022\tEngage students through project-based exercises\n\u2022\tUse the built environment to illustrate the relevance of math and science\n\u2022\tEmploy collaborative problem solving that involves all learners\n\nToday, we hold true to our founding principles.

All Salvadori curricula link to Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and grade-specific learning objectives.\n\nAfter participating in Salvadori programs, thousands of students see their world differently.  They understand how buildings stand up, how bridges support such heavy loads and, most importantly, they understand "why they need to know this."\n\nSalvadori students achieve a greater understanding of math and science than students in traditional learning environments; they see it and feel it in the classes they enter, the bridges they cross, and the communities they live in.\n\nCompensation Package:\n\n\u2022\tSalary: $42,000 (increased to $46,200 after a successful first year)\n\u2022\t52 leave days a year\no\t15 vacation days\no\t16 holidays\no\t2 personal days\no\t9 sick days\no\t10 days\' summer leave (typically two consecutive weeks in August)\n\u2022\tno-cost individual health insurance (no co-pays, deductibles, or contribution), plus vision, dental, and life insurance\n\u2022\t403(b) plan where Salvadori contributes an additional 5% of employees\' salaries without a matching requirement\n\nHow to Apply:\n\nSubmit resume, cover letter and sample lesson plan (if available) in PDF format only to thecenter@salvadori.org by 31 July 2017 with the subject line: Salvadori Educator Application and please mention where you saw this ad in your cover letter and if you are applying for a full-time or part-time position.\n\nPlease use this format when submitting your application: \n\n\u2022\tFirstInitialLastName_Document ~ for example: \no\tJSmith_Resume\no\tJSmith_CoverLetter\no\tJSmith_LessonPlan (if available)\n\nNo calls, please.\n    ')('Title', u'Salvadori Educator')('URL', u'https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/salvadori-educator/6209154931.html')('Compensation', u'$42,000')('Address', '')('Employment Type', u'full-time')

He showed students how math and science are part of the buildings, bridges, and communities that surround us.\nIn 1987, the Salvadori Center was founded with three main principles:\n\n\u2022\tEngage students through project-based exercises\n\u2022\tUse the built environment to illustrate the relevance of math and science\n\u2022\tEmploy collaborative problem solving that involves all learners\n\nToday, we hold true to our founding principles.  Salvadori\'s programs celebrate our collaborative, hands-on and project-based approach to learning through the built environment with programs that:\n\n\u2022\tPromote college and career readiness for all students\n\u2022\tEmphasize higher-order skills\n\u2022\tProduce student work that reflects high levels of thinking, participation, and ownership\n\nWe offer a variety of multi-day in-school and after-school programs that enable every child to succeed, as well as professional development workshops that provide teachers with a strong foundation in project-based learning.  All Salvadori curricula link to Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and grade-specific learning objectives.\n\nAfter participating in Salvadori programs, thousands of students see their world differently.  They understand how buildings stand up, how bridges support such heavy loads and, most importantly, they understand "why they need to know this."\n\nSalvadori students achieve a greater understanding of math and science than students in traditional learning environments; they see it and feel it in the classes they enter, the bridges they cross, and the communities they live in.\n\nCompensation Package:\n\n\u2022\tSalary: $70,000 to $75,000\n\u2022\t52 leave days a year\no\t15 vacation days\no\t16 holidays\no\t2 personal days\no\t9 sick days\no\t10 days\' summer leave (typically two consecutive weeks in August)\n\u2022\tno-cost individual health insurance (no co-pays, deductibles, or contribution), plus vision, dental, and life insurance\n\u2022\t403(b) plan where Salvadori contributes an additional 5% of employees\' salaries without a matching requirement\n\nHow to Apply:\n\nSubmit resume and cover letter in PDF format only to thecenter@salvadori.org by 31 July 2017 with the subject line: Salvadori Education Director Application and please mention where you saw this ad in your cover letter.\n\nPlease use this format when submitting your application: \n\n\u2022\tFirstInitialLastName_Document ~ for example: \no\tJSmith_Resume\no\tJSmith_CoverLetter\n\nNo calls, please.\n    ')('Title', u'Education Director')('URL', u'https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/education-director/6212937267.html')('Compensation', u'$70,000-$75,000')('Address', u'New York')('Employment Type', u'full-time')

If you think you lack any, don't apply. You won't find this a good fit. Our core values are fundamental to our company in that our team members enjoy working with each other, learning from each other, and our company relies on people acting with INTEGRITY and ACCOUNTABILITY. HUMILITY should be a core value of everyone, but we just happen to take it very seriously because the process of learning starts with being humble. To be humble is to be modest, to understand that we are all still learning about the world so we must be open to learning from others. AGILITY is also important because this position requires the team member to respond to multiple demands of their time with grace, patience, and creativity. We strive to have a positive work place, so only positive-thinking people are encouraged to apply. We also strive to create a jovial and creative work environment that leaves plenty of room for the team members to have their own well-balanced lives, but because we are also an ambitious company, sometimes things can get a little stressful, though we work hard to minimize the times of stress. If you can manage your stress with grace under pressure, then this might be a good fit for you.\n\nOur company offers comprehensive development services to the home owner or the high-rise builder, and we are constantly seeking out ways to improve, automate, and simplify the building process for those who want to build, but just need a bit of help.

We support our team members and make it a priority to help them grow in their areas of interest, be it improving their management skills, learning to become a builder, becoming project managers, or just taking on more responsibility for higher salary.
