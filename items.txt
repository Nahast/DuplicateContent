Our core values are fundamental to our company in that our team members enjoy working with each other, learning from each other, and our company relies on people acting with INTEGRITY and ACCOUNTABILITY.

He showed students how math and science are part of the buildings, bridges, and communities that surround us.\nIn 1987, the Salvadori Center was founded with three main principles:\n\n\u2022\tEngage students through project-based exercises\n\u2022\tUse the built environment to illustrate the relevance of math and science\n\u2022\tEmploy collaborative problem solving that involves all learners\n\nToday, we hold true to our founding principles.

All Salvadori curricula link to Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and grade-specific learning objectives.\n\nAfter participating in Salvadori programs, thousands of students see their world differently.  They understand how buildings stand up, how bridges support such heavy loads and, most importantly, they understand "why they need to know this."\n\nSalvadori students achieve a greater understanding of math and science than students in traditional learning environments; they see it and feel it in the classes they enter, the bridges they cross, and the communities they live in.\n\nCompensation Package:\n\n\u2022\tSalary: $42,000 (increased to $46,200 after a successful first year)\n\u2022\t52 leave days a year\no\t15 vacation days\no\t16 holidays\no\t2 personal days\no\t9 sick days\no\t10 days\' summer leave (typically two consecutive weeks in August)\n\u2022\tno-cost individual health insurance (no co-pays, deductibles, or contribution), plus vision, dental, and life insurance\n\u2022\t403(b) plan where Salvadori contributes an additional 5% of employees\' salaries without a matching requirement\n\nHow to Apply:\n\nSubmit resume, cover letter and sample lesson plan (if available) in PDF format only to thecenter@salvadori.org by 31 July 2017 with the subject line: Salvadori Educator Application and please mention where you saw this ad in your cover letter and if you are applying for a full-time or part-time position.\n\nPlease use this format when submitting your application: \n\n\u2022\tFirstInitialLastName_Document ~ for example: \no\tJSmith_Resume\no\tJSmith_CoverLetter\no\tJSmith_LessonPlan (if available)\n\nNo calls, please.\n    ')('Title', u'Salvadori Educator')('URL', u'https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/salvadori-educator/6209154931.html')('Compensation', u'$42,000')('Address', '')('Employment Type', u'full-time')

He showed students how math and science are part of the buildings, bridges, and communities that surround us.\nIn 1987, the Salvadori Center was founded with three main principles:\n\n\u2022\tEngage students through project-based exercises\n\u2022\tUse the built environment to illustrate the relevance of math and science\n\u2022\tEmploy collaborative problem solving that involves all learners\n\nToday, we hold true to our founding principles.  Salvadori\'s programs celebrate our collaborative, hands-on and project-based approach to learning through the built environment with programs that:\n\n\u2022\tPromote college and career readiness for all students\n\u2022\tEmphasize higher-order skills\n\u2022\tProduce student work that reflects high levels of thinking, participation, and ownership\n\nWe offer a variety of multi-day in-school and after-school programs that enable every child to succeed, as well as professional development workshops that provide teachers with a strong foundation in project-based learning.  All Salvadori curricula link to Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and grade-specific learning objectives.\n\nAfter participating in Salvadori programs, thousands of students see their world differently.  They understand how buildings stand up, how bridges support such heavy loads and, most importantly, they understand "why they need to know this."\n\nSalvadori students achieve a greater understanding of math and science than students in traditional learning environments; they see it and feel it in the classes they enter, the bridges they cross, and the communities they live in.\n\nCompensation Package:\n\n\u2022\tSalary: $70,000 to $75,000\n\u2022\t52 leave days a year\no\t15 vacation days\no\t16 holidays\no\t2 personal days\no\t9 sick days\no\t10 days\' summer leave (typically two consecutive weeks in August)\n\u2022\tno-cost individual health insurance (no co-pays, deductibles, or contribution), plus vision, dental, and life insurance\n\u2022\t403(b) plan where Salvadori contributes an additional 5% of employees\' salaries without a matching requirement\n\nHow to Apply:\n\nSubmit resume and cover letter in PDF format only to thecenter@salvadori.org by 31 July 2017 with the subject line: Salvadori Education Director Application and please mention where you saw this ad in your cover letter.\n\nPlease use this format when submitting your application: \n\n\u2022\tFirstInitialLastName_Document ~ for example: \no\tJSmith_Resume\no\tJSmith_CoverLetter\n\nNo calls, please.\n    ')('Title', u'Education Director')('URL', u'https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/education-director/6212937267.html')('Compensation', u'$70,000-$75,000')('Address', u'New York')('Employment Type', u'full-time')
